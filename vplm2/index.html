        <div class="solution">
          <p>PLM systems can become bogged down by poorly implemented automations. This can lead to engineers spending more time managing the system than designing products.</p>
          <p><strong>Agitate:</strong> Imagine an automated CAD drawing to PDF conversion that turns into a nightmare. Engineers have no idea if their conversion is stuck in a queue or if the server is down. Constant follow-up with PLM support slows everyone down. This automation becomes a bottleneck, hindering product development.</p>
          <p><strong>Solution:</strong> We provide clear visibility into PLM automations. A simple dashboard shows engineers the status of their conversion requests, reducing anxiety and support tickets by over 90%. This restores confidence in the PLM system and lets engineers focus on design.</p>
