However, the most critical component is often overlooked: the human workforce.</p><h3>Why People Matter</h3><p>Technology is an enabler, not a replacer. Our research shows that companies investing in upskilling their workforce see 3x higher ROI from digital initiatives.</p><h3>The Strategy</h3><p>We recommend a 'Human-First' approach where digital tools are designed to augment human capabilities, reducing repetitive tasks and freeing up time for creative problem solving.</p>"

        "<br><p>A minor component failure on a piece of farm equipment recently highlighted a multi-million dollar blind spot I see in many manufacturing enterprises. While companies invest heavily in a \"Digital Thread\" to connect data from design to production, they often miss the most critical data stream: the authentic, ",
